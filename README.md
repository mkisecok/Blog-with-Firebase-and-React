# Blog-with-Firebase and React

- In this Project i created a blog with autentication with google account by firebase. 
- User can write a blog and delete only his/her own post can not another.
- We can see the name of google account username and time of create blog time from now on. 
- The textarea component created by markdown type. 
- Material UI is my favourite react library because of that in this Project you can see more things from @mui
